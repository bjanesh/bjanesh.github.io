***about me***

I'm a third-year astronomy graduate student at [Indiana University](http://astro.indiana.edu), working with [Katherine Rhode](http://www.astro.indiana.edu/faculty/rhode.shtml). 
My research interests involve (broadly) Local Group cosmology and (narrowly) dwarf galaxies in the local universe. My dissertation project is based on observations of ultra-compact high velocity clouds from the [ALFALFA](http://egg.astro.cornell.edu/index.php/) neutral hydrogen survey. I use the WIYN telescope and its One Degree Imager to search for stellar counterparts to these objects, like Leo P (above), an extremely metal poor star-forming dwarf galaxy in the Local Group. I [presented](/media/aas15.poster.pdf) the methods for this project at the January 2015 AAS conference, [published](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...811...35J) initial results in September 2015, and [had a poster](/media/stsci16.poster.pdf) at the [2016 STScI Spring Symposium](http://www.cvent.com/events/2016-spring-symposium-what-shapes-galaxies-/event-summary-5a5fdf05ce3b48a38d7025e994ab807e.aspx).
I'm also a contributor to [odi-tools](https://github.iu.edu/wjanesh/odi-tools), a set of Python/Pyraf based scripts for stacking ODI images, and performing photometry tasks on the results.

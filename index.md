***about me***

I'm a third-year astronomy graduate student at [Indiana University](http://astro.indiana.edu), working with [Katherine Rhode](http://www.astro.indiana.edu/faculty/rhode.shtml). 
My research interests involve (broadly) Local Group cosmology and (narrowly) dwarf galaxies in the local universe. My dissertation project is based on observations of ultra-compact high velocity clouds from the [ALFALFA](http://egg.astro.cornell.edu/index.php/) neutral hydrogen survey. I use the WIYN telescope and its One Degree Imager to search for stellar counterparts to these objects, like Leo P (above), an extremely metal poor star-forming dwarf galaxy in the Local Group. I [presented](/media/poster.final.pdf) the methods for this project at the January 2015 AAS conference, and [published](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...811...35J) initial results in September 2015.
